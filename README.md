# Orbofu

Orbofu stands for "ORdinateur de BOrd pour FUsée à eau" (meaning in french water rocket flight computer).

Orbofu is a project I started in 2023 because I couldn't find a good enough open source water rocket flight computer using simple and available parts.

Orbofu is capable of recording various flight data, saving them in a usable format and triggering a parachute on apogee detection. You can connect to it from your smartphone (AP generated by orbofu) to see data of the latest flight, download data stored on orbofu and configure some useful settings.

### Goal

Easily built a water rocket flight computer with cheap and available parts and little to no soldering.

# Hardware

### Bill Of Materials

- ESP32 - I used a lolin S3 pro and I'm going to try a C3 pico to make the computer smaller and lighter, both connect over usb-C and have a dedicated I²C port and a battery port with a charging circuit, meaning less soldering. Any ESP32 S3 should easily work (minimal modifications to platformio.ini) and other ESP32 models might require a little more work. Edit: for now, it's not working :( so I switching boards
- BME390 barometric sensor (used as altimeter) - Cheaper less accurate alternatives like the BME388 should work with minimal changes to the code
- Cheap & lightweight Servomotor (soldering probably required for that one)
- 3.7V small battery (I used 250mAh ones) - **BE CAREFUL WITH THE POLARITY**
- I also used a lolin I²C cable to connect the BME390 to the ESP but soldering should work just fine

Price estimate: not sure for now

### Case

I plan to use raketfuedrockets' Phoenix 3D or aircommandrockets' modified version of it.
