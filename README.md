# Orbofu

Orbofu stands for "ORdinateur de BOrd pour FUsée à eau" (meaning in french water rocket flight computer).

Orbofu is a project I started in 2023 because I couldn't find a good and simple open source water rocket flight computer using easily available parts.

Orbofu is capable of recording various flight data, saving them in a usable format, triggering a parachute on apogee detection and works over wifi (network generated by orbofu).

### Goal

Easily built a water rocket flight computer with cheap and available parts and little to no soldering.

# How to build - Hardware

### Bill Of Materials

- ESP32 - I use a DFrobot firebeetle ESP32-E (DFR0654) but other esp32 should work with some modifications to the pins in main.cpp & config in platformio.ini.
  - Note: I tried first using a lolin S3 pro and a C3 pico because they were great on paper (connect over usb-C, dedicated I²C port, battery port with charging circuit, ...) but didn't work :( (mainly because of the non Qwiic I²C port not much ressources where available online)
- BME390 barometric sensor (used as altimeter) - Cheaper less accurate alternatives like the BME388 should work
- Cheap & lightweight sg90 Servomotor (other should work too but you will probably have to edit main.cpp)
- 3.7V small battery (I used 250mAh ones) - **BE CAREFUL WITH THE POLARITY**

Price estimate: not sure for now

### Case

I plan to use raketfuedrockets' Phoenix 3D or aircommandrockets' modified version of it.

# How to use - Software

### Setup

- Connect bmp over I²C (or SPI if you prefer but you will have to edit main.cpp) and servo
- Set the pins in main.cpp
- flash esp using platform.io
- get everything in your rocket, connect the battery and connect to the generated wifi network (SSID:orbofu, no password, IP:192.168.4.1)
- go to 192.168.4.1 in your browser (might change for a dns), you're now on the control web interface !

### Managing a flight

- connect to the web interface, get the rocket ready and press "arm"
- launch the rocket, orbofu will now log data and trigger the parachute at the right time (hopefully)
- reconnect to the web interface when you get your rocket back, **DOWNLOAD LAST FLIGHT DATA** if you want to keep it and start again if you want to

- (as a bonus I might add AsyncElegantOTA for eay updates for those interested)
